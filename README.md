# YouTube Project
---
- Create an application that displays some information getting from JSON. You can find the JSON data in this link [Youtube](https://api.letsbuildthatapp.com/youtube/home_feed)
- You need to do the following steps:
    1. Create `recyclerview` that will display the video information.
    2. The video information that we will display is `id`, `name of video`, `imageUrl`, `name of the channel`, and `numberOfViews`.
    3. Use Retrofit, Gson, and Coil libraries to do HTTP requests and JSON Parsing.

> Note: You can see JSON data in an organized way by using [Online Json Viewer.](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/)
